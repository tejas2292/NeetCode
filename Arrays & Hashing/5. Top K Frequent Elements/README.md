# Most Frequent Elements

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the `k` most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.

## Example 1

**Input:**

```plaintext
nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
k = 2
```
````

**Output:**

```plaintext
[1,2]
```

## Example 2

**Input:**

```plaintext
nums = [1]
k = 1
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
[1]
```

## Constraints

- \(1 \leq \text{nums.length} \leq 10^5\)
- \(-10^4 \leq \text{nums}[i] \leq 10^4\)
- `k` is in the range \([1, \text{number of unique elements in the array}]\).
- It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.

## Follow up

Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than \(O(n \log n)\), where `n` is the array's size.
